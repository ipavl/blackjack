* TODO: Implement aces acting as both 1 and 11.

# May 11, 2012 - v0.1.9pre (Build 16)
	* This is a pre-release build; splitting is currently partially implemented, but inaccessible. The rest of the 
	game should work fine, but bugs may pop up.

	- continued implementing splitting*
		- form now copies bets/balance over (bet is split in half between the two hands)
		- organized form better
		Note: was going to make it share the main form via groupboxes+visibility, but went with a separate form for now
	- Hit/Stand/Double/Split buttons now have image backgrounds
		- New Game/Surrender buttons ARE also made, but not implemented yet (wrong size)
		- added updater EXE + associated DLL to output folder, but currently is not included within the solution itself
			- updater currently links to my private (locally hosted) server, so it will not update unless you have a server
				running on the same IP (192.168.56.101) with a version.txt file and a blackjack.zip file in the folder:
				<root>/assets/files/blackjack/
			- TODO: Make client write its version to version.txt (or something of the like)

# May 6, 2012 - v0.1.8_01 (Build 15)
	- player "score" label now says "total" as it was originally supposed to say
	- split "check" now occurs after player card total has been defined so the button becomes enabled as it should

# May 6, 2012 - v0.1.8
	- split button is no longer enabled if the player has been dealt a card
	- doubling down with a balance less than the player's bet will now go "all in"
		- a balance of zero will not all the player to double down
	- fixed a bug where GameOver would be looped through multiple times, causing different messages
		(e.g. the player would bust, get told they busted, and then get told their hand is higher than the dealer's)
		
# May 4, 2012 - v0.1.7
	- added the ability to surrender a match
		- "New Game" button is now labelled "Surrender" if the game is in progress

	- added Double Down/Split buttons to form
	- implemented Double Down
		- bet x2, can only receive one card
	- began implementing Splitting
		- button is enabled if player is dealt two of the same cards (value-wise)

# May 4, 2012 - v0.1.6
	- fixed a bug where the dealer's first card would look for "<suit> -<card>" instead of "<suit>-<card>"
	- added a check for game draws for Stand() when dealerScore = playerScore
	- the maximum amount that can be entered into the betting numeric up/down control is now equal to the balance
	- Jacks, Queens, and Kings are now properly worth 10 each (instead of 11, 12, and 13, respectively)

# May 1, 2012 - v0.1.5_01
	- due to not being able to close the program when balance = 0, the betting form now closes it

# May 1, 2012 - v0.1.5
	- panels, image boxes, and labels now have transparent backgrounds
	- added win/draw "give money" condition to GameOver
		- win gives the player 1.5x their bet back
		- draw gives the player their bet back
		- loss gives the player nothing back
	- removed 'x' button from betting form to fix a "hack" (the interface now has rounded corners!)

# April 30, 2012 - v0.1.4
	- added betting interface
	- cleaned up a lot of repeated code by passing variables to a void to handle card filename/values
	- cleaned up a lot of repeated code with generating the card suits by using a method instead
